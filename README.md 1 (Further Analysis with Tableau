COVID-19 Data Analysis in Tableau with MySQL Queries

Description:
This Tableau project focuses on the analysis of COVID-19 data using MySQL queries to extract and transform the data for visualization in Tableau. The project includes a series of SQL queries designed to work with a dataset containing information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, locations, populations, and more. The SQL queries are structured to provide insights into the global impact of the pandemic, with a focus on summarizing and visualizing key statistics such as total cases, total deaths, death percentages, and infection rates.

Queries Used:
1. Global Numbers: Calculates total cases, total deaths, and the death percentage for COVID-19 data, filtering for specific conditions such as excluding locations with null continents and ordering the results by total cases and total deaths.

2. Total Deaths Per Continent: Retrieves the total death count for different locations, excluding specific entries like 'World,' 'European Union,' and 'International,' and orders the results by the total death count.

3. Percent Population Infected Per Country: Identifies the locations with the highest infection counts and calculates the percentage of the population infected for each location. The results are ordered by the percentage of the population infected.

4. Percent Population Infected: Similar to Query 3, but this query also considers the infection data over time by including the date in the analysis.

This project is suitable for anyone interested in analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 data using Tableau and MySQL. The provided SQL queries can be used to retrieve and preprocess data for Tableau dashboards and visualizations, making it a valuable resource for data enthusiasts and professionals.
